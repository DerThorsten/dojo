CS175 - Final Project
=====================
Fiona Wood and Daniel Haehn

We are using WebGL and JavaScript.

Stack-based volume rendering.

The main logic for creating the slices and mapping the textures is in index.html. The shaders are also defined there.

We use the following external libraries:
 - zlib.js to inflate raw segmentation data
 - gl-matrix.js for vectors and matrices
 - prototype.js and jsProgressBarHandler for the progressbar

To run:
 open index.html (uses a default segmentation id 3036)
   or
 open index.html?id=47 (or 3036 or 1251 for other structures)

SPACE: for switching between image and segmentation rendering
-/+: to increase/decrease opacity
